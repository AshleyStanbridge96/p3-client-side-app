## About
This repository will have a sprinkle about myself but the main focus will be teaching the reader what tools and resources they can reference during their adventures through website development.
## Recommended Tools
First things first...I'm the realest (had to drop a 2014 meme on you)

Okay, back to reality, first things first, if you want to publish a simple GitHub page for the world to view you will need a few things:
### Tools
- Reliable web browser such as [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (optional)

### Languages
- Markdown is the language you will utilize for creating a great README page such as the one your eyes are currently on. The next section will have links to some resources you can utilize if you are unfamiliar with the language.
- CSS, HTML, and JavaScript will be useful down the road but not immediately needed (see details below).

Once you have downloaded the tools and got a handle of the markdown language, try creating a README.md file! See the resources below in the next section if you are unsure on how to create the needed repository for your README file, then come back and let's learn how to publish your README through GitHub pages so you can send it to friends and family. 

Now that you have a repository and a README, here are the steps to publish it:
1. Go to your repository's home page
2. Click on settings
3. Scroll down until you see "GitHub Pages"
4. Under source, select master branch
5. The page will reload and send you to the top, scroll back to "GitHub Pages" and click on the link provided
    - If the link throws an error, copy the link and go back to your repository's home page. Click edit, then paste that URL into the space provided and select save. Try opening the link again. 

## Recommended Resources
- Here's that [Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) link I promised. This will walk you through the basics and have you practice writing in the language.
    - If you would rather explore a guide, then check out this [getting started guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) for markdown
- Using GitHub can be very confusing at first, so look through this [GitHub Basics](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) page to get more comfortable with some of the cool features offered
- Visual Studio Code offers a [tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics) on their site over the basics of their program. Do not take this tool for granted because it offers a lot of neat stuff! Including extensions available for download within the program to make your life easier, so take advantage!
- Markdown is a nice light-weight language to get you started but eventually you will want to move on to the main fundamentals of website development, and that is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here are a few resources to become a master at these languages:
    - [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) will get you started with documentation and examples of each language
    - When you feel you have grasped the main concepts of each language, put your skills to the test and [practice](https://html-css-js.com/). This site offers a text editor for practice as well as a cheat sheet and the websites own helpful links.

Remember, you have to make mistakes to learn, so don't get stressed over your code, only learn from your mistakes.

Just because I know how much the Internet loves cats, here's another pic of the legend kitty in a perfectly normal and not odd position at all.
